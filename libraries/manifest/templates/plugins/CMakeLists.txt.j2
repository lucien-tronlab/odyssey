# The `odyssey_mf_plugins` target has prototypes for querying plugins
# as abstract, but does not itself define the plugins.
#
# The reason for this design is that if we try to use `plugins`
# we will have this circular dependency:
#
# ```
# xxx_plugin ===> odyssey::app ===> plugins ===> xxx_plugin
# ```
#
# To break the dependency, we create `mf_plugins` which only
# has a "weak" reference to the plugin:
#
# ```
# xxx_plugin ===> odyssey::app ===> mf_plugins ---> xxx_plugin
# ```
#
# This weak reference is implemented by a declaring a
# `create_xxx_plugin()` global function which returns a
# `shared_ptr< abstract_plugin >`.  The weak reference isn't
# resolved until link time.  So as long as we link with both
# `odyssey_mf_plugins` and `odyssey_plugins` we are fine.
